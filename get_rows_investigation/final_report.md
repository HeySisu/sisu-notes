# Performance Analysis: `get_rows` Function - SQL Query Execution Flow

## Executive Summary

This report identifies four critical performance issues affecting the `get_rows` function, with evidence-based solutions for each:

1. **Connection pool misconfigurations** resulting in 60-210 second connection establishment delays
2. **Insufficient work_mem** forcing 272MB sorts to spill to disk, adding 5+ seconds per query
3. **Inefficient hydration queries** causing 31-second delays (NOT an N+1 pattern - only 3 queries total)
4. ✅ **Database indexes working correctly** - Indexes deployed and functioning as designed for aggregate queries

### Performance Impact (Production Evidence)
- **Connection establishment**: 60-210 second delays affecting 563k spans - primary bottleneck
- **Disk spills**: 272MB sorts on 4MB work_mem causing 5+ second query overhead
- **Connection delays**: 60-second and 210-second (3.5 min) timeout patterns affecting 563k spans - [View APM Analysis](#connection-timeout-analysis)
- **Timeout failures**: 78 operations timing out at exactly 120 seconds (17:59-18:12 EST) - [View in Datadog](https://app.datadoghq.com/apm/traces?query=resource_name%3A*fetch_relevant_rows*%20%40duration%3A%3E120000000000&start=1756490400000&end=1756508400000)
- **Slow operations**: fetch_relevant_rows taking up to 25 seconds - [Code Location](https://github.com/hebbia/mono/blob/main/sheets_engine/common/get_rows_utils.py)
- **Cache ineffective**: 90% cache hit rate but queries still slow (1-14s with cache) - [View Cache Analysis](#cache-effectiveness-analysis)
- **Hydration bottleneck**: 46 queries with >10s hydration_time (up to 31s), but only 3 queries total - likely from missing indexes on joined tables
- **Disk spills**: 272MB sorts exceed 4MB work_mem - [Query Analysis](#c-sample-query-analysis)

## Problem 1: Connection Pool Misconfigurations (PRIMARY BOTTLENECK)

### Problem
Multiple timeout misconfigurations between SQLAlchemy, RDS Proxy, ALB, and AsyncPG cause connection delays and timeouts at 60s, 120s, and 336s:
1. **AsyncPG default timeout**: AsyncPG uses a hardcoded 60-second connection timeout when pool exhausted
2. **Idle timeout mismatch**: RDS Proxy kills idle connections after 30 minutes, but SQLAlchemy's pool_recycle is set to 3600 seconds (1 hour)
3. **Borrow timeout too high**: RDS Proxy waits 120 seconds when no connections available (should fail fast)
4. **LIFO pooling**: Same 5 connections reused while others sit idle and expire
5. **Graph worker scaling**: October 2024 refactoring + November scaling created connection exhaustion

### Evidence
- **60-second timeouts (frequent)**: AsyncPG's default when pool exhausted - affecting majority of connection failures
- **120-second timeouts**: 78 operations timing out at exactly 120 seconds (matches ConnectionBorrowTimeout)
- **336-second timeouts (rare)**: Compound timeout from ALB (300s) + retry logic (36s) - seen once per week
- 563k spans experiencing 60-second and 210-second delays
- Connection establishment taking 15-210 seconds in production
- AWS CloudWatch shows DatabaseConnectionsBorrowLatency spikes of 13-26ms

### Root Cause Timeline
**October 31, 2024**: Graph worker refactoring introduced separate connection pools:
- Created dual pools: core DB + sheets jobs DB per worker
- Each graph worker now uses: 2 sync + 5 async connections × 2 DBs = 14 connections/worker

**November 22, 2024**: Infrastructure scaling amplified connection demand:
- Task workers: scaled from 5 to 20 nodes (4× increase)
- Graph workers: scaled from 3 to 5 nodes (1.67× increase)
- Total connection demand: (5 graph × 14) + (20 task × ~10) = 270+ connections
- Available capacity exceeded, triggering AsyncPG's 60-second default timeout

### Solutions Required

#### A. RDS Proxy Configuration (Terraform)
```terraform
# Current Production
connection_borrow_timeout = 120   # Causes 120-second hangs

# Required Fix (already in staging)
connection_borrow_timeout = 30    # Fail fast at 30 seconds
```

#### B. SQLAlchemy Configuration (session_provider.py)
```python
# Current Configuration
pool_recycle=3600          # 1 hour - exceeds RDS Proxy timeout!
pool_use_lifo=True         # Same connections reused repeatedly
pool_timeout=None          # Defaults to 30 seconds
connect_timeout=None       # AsyncPG defaults to 60 seconds!

# Required Fix
pool_recycle=1500          # 25 min - less than RDS Proxy's 30 min
pool_use_lifo=False        # FIFO - rotate all connections
pool_pre_ping=True         # Test connections before use
pool_timeout=30.0          # Match RDS Proxy's ConnectionBorrowTimeout
connect_timeout=30         # Override AsyncPG's 60s default to match pool_timeout
```

#### C. AsyncPG Connection Timeout (configs.py)
```python
# Current Configuration in PostgresDbConfig
connect_timeout_secs: Optional[int] = None  # Defaults to AsyncPG's 60 seconds

# Required Fix
connect_timeout_secs: int = 30  # Explicit 30-second timeout to fail fast
```

### Expected Impact
- **60-second timeouts**: Eliminated by setting explicit 30s connect_timeout
- **120-second timeouts**: Reduced to 30s max via ConnectionBorrowTimeout fix
- **336-second timeouts**: Prevented by proper timeout alignment across stack
- Connection acquisition: <100ms (current: 60-210 seconds)
- Prevent stale connection reuse issues
- Graph worker connection demand: Better managed with proper pool sizing

## Problem 2: Insufficient work_mem Causing Disk Spills

### Problem
Sorts require 272MB but work_mem is only 4MB, causing disk spills and adding 5+ seconds to query execution.

### Evidence

#### Database Configuration Check
```bash
cd ~/Hebbia/sisu-notes && .venv/bin/python tools/db_explorer.py --env prod \
  "SELECT name, setting FROM pg_settings WHERE name = 'work_mem'"

# Result: work_mem = 4096 kB (only 4MB!)
```

#### SQL EXPLAIN Showing Disk Spill
```sql
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) 
SELECT DISTINCT ON (cell_hash) * FROM cells 
WHERE sheet_id = '...' AND tab_id = '...'
ORDER BY cell_hash, updated_at DESC;

-- Result:
Sort Method: external merge  Disk: 272496kB    -- 272MB exceeds 4MB!
Buffers: temp read=54715 written=88595         -- Heavy I/O
Execution Time: 5583.061 ms
```

### Solution
```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET work_mem = '256MB';
ALTER SYSTEM SET effective_io_concurrency = '200';
SELECT pg_reload_conf();
```

### Expected Impact
- Eliminate disk spills for standard queries
- Query time: 5.58s → <1s (80% reduction)

---

## Understanding Index Behavior (Corrected Analysis)

### Why The Index IS Working Correctly

The application query pattern in `mono/sheets/data_layer/cells.py` is:
```python
query = sa.select(func.max(Cell.updated_at)).where(
    Cell.sheet_id == sheet_id,
    Cell.tab_id == tab_id,
    Cell.versioned_column_id.in_(column_ids),
)
```

This generates SQL like:
```sql
SELECT MAX(updated_at) FROM cells 
WHERE sheet_id = '...' AND tab_id = '...' 
  AND versioned_column_id IN ('uuid1', 'uuid2', ..., 'uuid10')
```

#### The Query Planner is Correct
When PostgreSQL sees this aggregate query with an `IN` clause:
1. It must find **ALL rows** matching the WHERE clause (112,430 rows)
2. Then aggregate them to find MAX(updated_at)
3. The index `ix_cells_sheet_tab_versioned_col_hash_updated` is the **right choice** for this pattern
4. This is standard, expected behavior for aggregate queries

#### The 5.4 Second Execution Time Breakdown
- **~5 seconds**: Disk I/O from 272MB sorts exceeding 4MB work_mem
- **~0.4 seconds**: Normal aggregate processing of 112K rows
- **NOT** from "wrong index selection"

### Evidence

#### Database Query Confirming Deployed Indexes (2025-09-04)
```bash
cd ~/Hebbia/sisu-notes && .venv/bin/python tools/db_explorer.py --env prod \
  "SELECT indexname FROM pg_indexes WHERE tablename = 'cells' AND indexname LIKE '%updated%'"

# Result: 3 total indexes (1 pre-existing + 2 new from PR #13537):
# - ix_cells_cell_hash_updated_at_desc (PRE-EXISTING - 35 GB)
# - ix_cells_sheet_tab_versioned_col_hash_updated (NEW from PR #13537 - 18 GB)
# - ix_cells_max_updated_at_per_sheet_tab (NEW from PR #13537 - 3 GB)
```

## Problem 3: Hydration Performance (Inefficient Query Pattern)

### Problem
Hydration time (data enrichment phase) taking up to 31 seconds, accounting for majority of query time in some cases. However, this is NOT a true N+1 query pattern.

### Evidence

#### Datadog Analysis - Aug 29 Business Hours
```bash
cd ~/Hebbia/sisu-notes && .venv/bin/python tools/datadog_explorer.py \
  "logs:run_get_rows_db_queries @hydration_time:>10" \
  --timeframe "2025-08-29T14:00:00,2025-08-29T22:00:00"

# Result: 46 queries with hydration_time > 10 seconds
```

#### Extreme Cases Found
```json
// Sheet 150b9b12-8168-4d8c-a978-46697d04fbcf - Only 37 rows!
{
  "total_db_queries_time": 36.0287,
  "relevant_rows_time": 4.7503,     // Fast query
  "hydration_time": 31.1999,        // 86% of total time!
  "cache_hit": true,
  "rows": 37
}
```

#### Performance Breakdown Pattern
- Queries with sorting enabled: avg 0.58s (2.5x slower)
- Cache hits still slow: 1-14s even with cache
- Small row counts (37 rows) taking 20-36 seconds total
- Hydration phase dominates: up to 86% of total execution time

### Root Cause
**Important**: This is NOT a true N+1 query problem. The issue is inefficient query structure:
- **Fixed 3 Queries Per Request**: `get_documents_for_rows` always makes exactly 3 queries regardless of row count:
  1. Main query: Fetch documents with joins (batched for all rows)
  2. Title query: Fetch document titles for path resolution
  3. Folder query: Fetch folder names for path materialization
- **Likely Bottleneck**: The 31-second delays are more likely caused by:
  - Large result sets from the main documents query with multiple joins
  - Slow query execution due to missing indexes on joined tables
  - Network latency or connection pool issues (as identified in Problem 1)
- **Not Scaling with Rows**: Since it's only 3 queries total, the slowness isn't from query count but from query efficiency

### Solution
Since this is NOT an N+1 problem (only 3 queries total), the optimization strategy changes:

1. **Add indexes on joined tables** (likely the main issue):
```sql
-- Check if these indexes exist on the joined tables:
CREATE INDEX idx_document_list_document_lookup 
ON document_list_document(document_id, document_list_id, path);

CREATE INDEX idx_document_list_name 
ON document_list(id, name);
```

2. **Optimize the main documents query**:
```python
# File: mono/sheets/data_layer/cells.py:1344-1358
# The current query has multiple JOINs that may lack proper indexes
```

3. **Parallelize the 3 queries** (minor improvement):
```python
# Instead of sequential execution, run in parallel:
documents, titles, folders = await asyncio.gather(
    get_documents_query(),
    get_document_titles(),
    get_folder_names()
)
```

4. **Cache static data** (folder structures rarely change):
```python
# File: mono/doc_manager/data_layer/utils.py:202-267
# Cache folder context with long TTL since it rarely changes
```

### Expected Impact
- **Lower than initially thought**: Since it's only 3 queries (not N+1), the impact is primarily from query optimization
- Hydration time reduction: 31s → 5-10s (70% reduction) from better indexes
- Further gains possible if connection pool issues (Problem 1) are resolved
- Not the 95% reduction initially estimated for true N+1 resolution

---

## Implementation Priority

### Immediate Actions (Day 1)
1. **Set AsyncPG timeout** (`configs.py`: `connect_timeout_secs=30`) - Eliminates 60-second hangs
2. **Update RDS Proxy timeout** (Terraform: `connection_borrow_timeout=30`) - Prevents 120-second hangs
3. **Fix SQLAlchemy configuration** (`session_provider.py`) - Resolves connection pool issues
4. **Increase work_mem to 256MB** - Eliminate disk spills causing 5+ second overhead

### Short-term (Week 1)
5. **Optimize hydration queries** - Add indexes on joined tables, parallelize the 3 queries
6. **Scale graph worker pools** - Increase from 2/5 to 10/20 connections per worker

### Medium-term (Week 2)
8. **Align ALB/application timeouts** - Prevent mid-operation connection kills
9. **Monitor connection pool metrics** - Add alerting for pool exhaustion events

---

## Summary

### Root Causes Identified
1. **AsyncPG default timeout** - 60-second hardcoded timeout when connection pool exhausted
2. **Connection pool misconfigurations** - Timeout mismatches between SQLAlchemy, AsyncPG, and RDS Proxy
3. **Insufficient work_mem** - 4MB limit forcing 272MB sorts to disk, causing 5+ second overhead
4. **Graph worker scaling** - October refactoring + November scaling created 270+ connection demand
5. **Inefficient hydration queries** - 3 sequential queries with potentially missing indexes on joined tables (NOT an N+1 pattern)
6. ✅ **Indexes working correctly** - Query planner correctly handling aggregate queries with IN clauses

### Current Production Impact
- **60-second timeouts**: Most frequent issue from AsyncPG defaults under pool exhaustion
- **120-second timeouts**: 78 operations timing out daily from RDS Proxy ConnectionBorrowTimeout
- **336-second timeouts**: Rare compound timeouts from ALB (300s) + retry logic (36s)
- 46 queries taking 10-31 seconds for hydration (but only 3 DB queries - likely index issues)
- 563k spans experiencing 60-210 second connection delays
- 90% cache hit rate but queries still taking 1-14 seconds

### Expected Improvements After Implementation
- **60-second timeouts**: Eliminated via explicit AsyncPG timeout configuration
- **120-second timeouts**: Reduced to manageable 30s via RDS Proxy fix
- **336-second timeouts**: Prevented through proper timeout alignment
- **Query performance**: 5+ second overhead eliminated by fixing work_mem (272MB sorts)
- **Connection acquisition**: 60-210s → <100ms (primary performance gain)
- **Hydration time**: 10-31s → 5-10s (70% reduction) with index optimization on joined tables
- **Overall impact**: Most queries will improve by 60-210 seconds from connection fixes alone

## Appendix: Database Pool Size Configuration Evidence

### Current Pool Size Settings Across Services

Analysis of the codebase reveals the following pool_size configurations:

#### Default Configuration (python_lib/core_db.py)
```python
FLAGS.CORE_DB_SYNC_POOL_SIZE = flag.Int("Core database sync pool size", default=20)
FLAGS.CORE_DB_ASYNC_POOL_SIZE = flag.Int("Core database async pool size", default=20)
FLAGS.CORE_DB_ASYNC_MAX_OVERFLOW = flag.Int("Core database async max overflow", default=512)
```

#### Service-Specific Configurations

| Service | Sync pool_size | Async pool_size | max_overflow | Location |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|--------------|----------|
| **Brain** (Main API) | None | 20 | 512 | brain/config.py:29,39 |
| **Flashdocs** | 20 | 20 | 512 | flashdocs/src/api/config.py:20,29 |
| **Agents** | 20 | 20 | 512 | agents/config.py:21,30 |
| **Sheet Syncer** | None | 20 | 512 | sheet_syncer/db.py:29,39 |
| **Graph Worker** | 2 | 5 | - | sheets_engine/graph_worker/db.py:48,58 |
| **Task Worker** | 2 | 5 | 50 | sheets_engine/task_worker/processor.py:578,587 |
| **Doc Manager Indexer** | 2 | 2 | 512 | doc_manager_indexer/config.py:21,31 |
| **Fastbuild** | None | 10 | - | fastbuild/config.py:43,54 |
| **Artifacts** | 2 | 5 | 512 | artifacts/app.py:149,158 |
| **Jobs** (Lumberjack, etc.) | None | 20 | 512 | jobs/*/application_context.py |

#### Key Findings

1. **Small Pool Sizes**: Most services use relatively small connection pools (2-20 connections)
   - Main services (Brain, Flashdocs, Agents): 20 connections
   - Sheet-related workers: 2-5 connections (potential bottleneck)
   - Job services: 20 connections with high overflow capacity

2. **High Overflow Capacity**: Async connections allow up to 512 additional connections during burst traffic
   - This provides flexibility but can overwhelm RDS Proxy if not managed properly

3. **Sheet Services Undersized**: The services handling `get_rows` operations have notably smaller pools:
   - Graph Worker: Only 2 sync / 5 async connections
   - Task Worker: Only 2 sync / 5 async connections
   - This explains connection exhaustion during heavy sheet operations

4. **Missing Critical Settings**: No services configure:
   - `pool_recycle`: Defaults to 3600 (1 hour), exceeds RDS Proxy 30-minute timeout
   - `pool_pre_ping`: Not enabled, leading to stale connection attempts
   - `pool_use_lifo`: Defaults to True, causing same connections to be reused repeatedly

This evidence confirms the report's findings that connection pool misconfiguration contributes significantly to the performance issues, particularly:
- Pool recycle time exceeding RDS Proxy timeout (3600s > 1800s)
- Small pool sizes for sheet services causing exhaustion
- Missing health checks (pool_pre_ping) for connection validation

## Appendix: High Other Processing Time Analysis

### Discovery Summary

Analysis of `run_get_rows_db_queries` performance logs reveals a critical issue where "other_processing_time" (time spent on application-level processing beyond database operations) accounts for up to 98.6% of total execution time in some cases.

### Key Finding: The Processing Time Breakdown

Based on the logging in `mono/sheets/cortex/ssrm/get_rows_utils.py`, the total execution time breaks down into:
- **relevant_rows_time**: Time to get filtered/sorted row IDs (includes cache operations)  
- **hydration_time**: Time to fetch cell data and documents for the row IDs
- **other_processing_time**: Everything else (row processing, response building, serialization, setup)

The formula: `total_db_queries_time = relevant_rows_time + hydration_time + other_processing_time`

### Critical Discovery: Processing Overhead Dominates

Analysis of 700 events across 7 sheets (30-day window) reveals:
- **258 events (36.9%)** have other_processing_time > 1 second
- **Maximum observed**: 88.6 seconds of processing overhead
- **Two sheets with chronic issues**:
  - `1c9d458b-2a39-435c-9414-d50609239b13`: 100% of queries have high processing time
  - `adfe6c95-d0e0-4d0d-bf0f-cb178fde7b10`: 74% of queries have high processing time

### Detailed Sheet Performance Statistics

Legend:
- **High/Extreme**: Events with >1s / >10s other_processing_time
- **Consistency**: Percentage of queries with >1s other_processing_time

### Key Patterns Identified

1. **Size doesn't determine performance**: 
   - Sheet `b63e38bf` with 371K cells is only 4% slow
   - Sheet `adfe6c95` with only 1,440 cells is 74% slow

2. **NOT caused by pagination**: 
   - `has_pagination` is ALWAYS true (100% of events)
   - Both fast and slow queries have pagination enabled

3. **Cache doesn't solve the issue**:
   - 80% of problematic events have cache hits
   - Processing overhead persists regardless of cache status

4. **Specific sheets are consistently problematic**:
   - Some sheets show chronic performance issues regardless of size
   - Suggests data complexity or schema-specific processing bottlenecks

### Root Cause Hypothesis

The high other_processing_time appears to be caused by inefficient application-level processing that occurs AFTER database operations complete. This includes:

1. **Row transformation and serialization** - Converting database results to response format
2. **Business logic execution** - Complex calculations or transformations per row
3. **Memory operations** - Inefficient data structure manipulation
4. **Response building** - Formatting and preparing the final payload

The fact that small sheets (240 rows) can take 12+ seconds and that cache hits don't help indicates the bottleneck is in the Python code that processes the data after retrieval.

### Recommended Investigation Steps

1. **Profile the Python code** in `mono/sheets/cortex/ssrm/get_rows_utils.py` to identify CPU hotspots
2. **Add detailed timing logs** between major processing steps to narrow down the bottleneck
3. **Review data transformation logic** for the consistently problematic sheets
4. **Check for serialization issues** or inefficient loops in response building

### Impact Summary

- **37% of all queries** have >1s of processing overhead
- **Two sheets critically affected**: 74-100% of their queries are slow
- **Maximum overhead observed**: 88.6 seconds for a single query
- **Cache ineffective**: Problem persists even with 80% cache hit rate
