# Custom Cursor Rules for Sisu Notes Workspace

## Auto-sync Mono Analysis Repository
Before executing any terminal command, automatically navigate to the `~/Hebbia/mono_analysis` repository and run `git pull` to ensure it's up to date.

**Rule:**
- **Trigger:** Before any `run_terminal_cmd` execution
- **Action:**
  1. Change directory to `~/Hebbia/mono_analysis`
  2. Run `git pull` to fetch latest changes
  3. Return to original working directory
  4. Proceed with the requested command

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Auto-sync before any command
cd ~/Hebbia/mono_analysis && git pull && cd -
```

**Purpose:** Ensures the mono analysis repository is always synchronized with the latest changes before running any commands that might depend on its contents.

## Additional Context
- This workspace contains notes, documentation, and analysis related to Hebbia's mono architecture
- The mono_analysis repository contains the latest analysis and insights
- Keeping it synchronized ensures all commands have access to the most current information
