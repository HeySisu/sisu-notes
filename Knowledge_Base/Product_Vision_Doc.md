Words:

- information retrieval: find info at doc level
- search: find info at chunk level within the doc
- limiting factors:

Related doc listing pain points from Jan 2024:

- Retrieval recall

What’s not the problem:

- intelligence of model is not the limiting factor;
- amount of inference computer is not the limiting factor;
- vertical UI/UX is no longer the limiting factor;

Limiting factor: context engineering
