- [Technical Deep Dive](./technical_deep_dive.md)

**Note**: This is a suggested baseline process. Teams can make adjustments based on specific needs:
- **Pre-onsite flexibility for remote hires**: Move additional onsite rounds to pre-onsite (e.g., system design, behavior) to ensure stronger mutual fit before travel burden
- **Role-specific templates**: Coding, system design, and practical project interviews have specialized variants for Backend, Frontend, Data Engineering, Research Engineering, and DevOps roles

### Rating Scale

Each building block uses this rating scale:

- **Strong Yes**: Exceptional candidate, clear hire
- **Yes**: Good candidate, likely hire with positive team consensus
- **No**: Concerns about role fit or level appropriateness
- **Strong No**: Clear concerns, not a good fit

## Open Questions

1. **Too much coding for P1/P2 in the onsite?**
   - Current: Both pre-onsite coding (~60min) and onsite coding (~60min) for P1-P2
   - Potential solution: Replace onsite coding with system design for better signal?

2. **Should P1-P3 have executive interviews?**
   - Currently excluded for junior/mid-level roles
   - Consider adding for culture fit and mutual assessment?
