## Process Variations


### A. Non-Local Candidates
- Move onsite rounds to pre-onsite before travel
- Virtual onsite option available
- Can split across multiple days

### B. Candidates with Pending Offers
- Combine coding and HM screening into one session
- Complete all rounds within decision timeline

### C. Executive Interview Evolution
Current: VP Eng conducts onsite HM interview; CEO & CTO conduct post-onsite interviews

Transition: Enable HMs for onsite behavior round; VP Eng & CTO for post-onsite

Target: HMs conduct onsite; single VP Eng post-onsite interview

### D. Role-Specific Adjustments
Specialized variants for Backend, Frontend, Data, Research, and DevOps roles

---

### Rating Scale

Each building block uses a 1-4 scale:

- **4 - Strong Yes**: Exceptional candidate, clear hire
- **3 - Yes**: Good candidate, hire with positive consensus
- **2 - No**: Concerns about role fit or level
- **1 - Strong No**: Not a good fit

---

## Rollout Process


### Phase 1: Pre-onsite and Post-onsite
- Standardize pre-onsite rounds
- Standardize CEO/CTO post-onsite interviews
- Add VP Eng to onsite
- Keep existing onsite during transition

### Phase 2: Onsite Evolution
- Replace existing onsite rounds
- Pilot with select teams
- Gather feedback and iterate
- Full rollout after validation

### Phase 3: Continuous Improvement
- Track metrics: time-to-hire, candidate experience, quality
- Iterate based on data
- Calibrate interviewer standards

## Open Questions

1. **Onsite duration**
   - Current: 3.75-5 hours by level
   - Proposed: 1-2 rounds → lunch → 2 rounds
   - Consider evaluation depth vs. candidate fatigue

2. **Technical Deep Dive for P4+**
   - Already have: coding, system design, practical project
   - Does it add unique signal?
