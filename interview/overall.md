## Process Variations


### A. Non-Local Candidates
- Move onsite rounds to pre-onsite before travel
- Offer virtual onsite option
- Split across multiple days if needed

### B. Candidates with Pending Offers
- Combine coding and HM screening
- Complete rounds within decision timeline

### C. Executive Interview Evolution
**Current**: VP Eng conducts onsite HM interview; CEO & CTO conduct post-onsite
**Transition**: HMs conduct onsite behavior round; VP Eng & CTO for post-onsite
**Target**: HMs conduct onsite; single VP Eng post-onsite interview

### D. Role-Specific Adjustments
Customize for Backend, Frontend, Data, Research, and DevOps roles

## Open Questions

1. **Onsite duration**: Balance evaluation depth with candidate fatigue (3.75-5 hours)

2. **Technical Deep Dive for P4+**: Does it add unique signal beyond coding, system design, and practical project?

3. **System Design during Phase 1**: What approach for system design interviews while the new block is being developed?

4. **Timeline feasibility**: Is the timeline too aggressive for block development and pilot phases?

5. **GitHub migration**: Plan to move all documentation and question banks to GitHub repository
