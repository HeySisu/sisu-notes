**Note**: This is a suggested baseline process. Teams can make adjustments based on specific needs:
- **Pre-onsite flexibility**: Move additional onsite rounds to pre-onsite (e.g., system design, behavior) to ensure stronger mutual fit before travel costs
- **Role-specific templates**: Coding, system design, and practical project interviews have specialized variants for Backend, Frontend, Data Engineering, Research Engineering, and DevOps roles

### Rating Scale

Each building block uses this rating scale:

- **Strong Yes**: Exceptional candidate, clear hire
- **Yes**: Good candidate, likely hire with positive team consensus
- **No**: Concerns about role fit or level appropriateness
- **Strong No**: Clear concerns, not a good fit
