# Engineering Manager of Managers Interview

## Hiring Manager Screen (30 min)

Make sure the Hiring Manager knows the candidate early, understand candidate's background and level.

### The Role (15 min)

Opportunity: focus areas; how team's goal relates to Stripe; team composition and growth plan; impact on users; roadmap; cross-functional teams.

### Background (5 min)

- Team organization: size & composition; number of direct and indirect reports; roles managed (IC, EM, PM, TPM); seniority structure; specializations (ML)
- Team responsibilities: business goals; technical ownership areas
- Roles previous to this one

### Screen Questions (2 min each)

- Tell me about the best feedback you've received recently
- Tell me about the hardest feedback you had to deliver to someone on your team recently
- Tell me about the most important technical decision your team made recently. How involved were you? Was the decision correct? How do you know?

### Rubric

Clear role fit, given the characteristics of the role you're hiring for. Answers to screener questions suggest that the candidate will ace the rest of the loop.

## Execution (45 min)

Measure: knows how to ship high-quality software quickly; drives constant improvement in team processes; operational rigor.

### Quality, Speed, and the Tradeoffs Between the Two

- How do you track work across the teams in your organization?
- Tell me about a time when your org produced work that was not high enough quality. How did you know? What did you do?
- How do you collect feedback from users? Give me an example of a time when talking to a user changed a project's direction.
- Tell me about a time when you had to meet a customer deliverable on a seemingly impossible schedule.
- Which of the teams in your org is performing the best? How do you know?
- Which of the teams in your org needs the most help? How do you know? How are you helping?
- Tell me about a time when you had to make a tradeoff between execution speed and the quality (technical quality or product quality) of the end result. How did you make the call? Was it the right call?

### Constant Improvement

- Describe a time when a project went off track.
- What happened? How did you fix it?
- If there was a manager on your team directly responsible for the work, to what extent did you fix the issue via helping them manage the situation, vs diving in yourself?
- What was the root cause of the issue?
- How have you changed your approach so that this won't happen again?

### Operational Rigor

- What are some of the key top level metrics you look at to measure the operational experience customers of your systems are getting? Could you pick a specific system and walk through the top level operational metrics for that system?
- What are a few activities you've done to improve the operational state of your systems?
- Have you had to introduce a culture of operational focus to a team that didn't have one? If yes, how did you go about doing that? How do you know if you were successful? How would you describe the current state of operational focus in that team?
- What's an interesting operational incident you've been involved in? Could you walk through it for us? What was the impact? How did you detect and mitigate the incident? What was your post-incident review process? What were some of your learnings from this incident? What are some of the long lasting changes you made as a result of this incident?

### Rubric

- Master of execution. You personally feel inspired to manage your team better after this interview.
- Can identify serious mistakes that they've made and how they learned from them. Believe they have further mistakes ahead of them, and don't believe that they've learned it all. Acknowledge situations that were difficult for them, and have grown able to succeed within them.
- Has a clear set of 2-3 top level metrics that speak to customer experience, and are not bottoms up. Is able to describe the timeliness and effectiveness of these metrics. Other times, getting good metrics requires multiple iterations. Can walk through the journey if they were involved in building these, and didn't just adopt what was already there. Can clearly describe how they keep a pulse on operation state, and drive improvements. Descriptions cover org processes, and technical work. Description of an operational incident is crisp, shows good processes during and post incident, and shows thoughtful and insightful learnings. Importantly, they should be very self-critical and honest about shortcoming in areas they managed.

## Setting Direction (45 min)

TC thinks about developing a strategy and putting it into action. First focus on understanding the scale or complexity of the environment and the challenges, then move to the development of the strategy or charter, and finally talk through execution and evaluation.

### Guidance

- Do you currently work with a PM? What is your job vs. their job? What is good vs. bad about that?
- What hard tradeoffs did you make this year?
- How have you balanced between new feature development, investments in security or reliability, KTLO, and refactoring existing code? How about tolling / developer productivity?
- Tell me about a time you inherited a team and needed to set or change the overall strategy or charter.
- How did you know that the old strategy was bad?
- How did you change the strategy impact the roadmap?
- How did you communicate the new plan? What pushback did you get?
- Was the new strategy successful? How do you know? Would you do anything different?

### Possible follow up questions

- Tell me about a time you pushed through an important decision or changed despite pushback from your manager, peers, or company leadership.
- Tell me about a time you influenced the direction of other teams around you or the company at large.
- Tell me about a time you advocated for funding, was your request granted? Why or why not, and was that the right outcome?

### Rubric

Reasoned exceptionally clearly about strategy or charter, leading to non-obvious and substantial wins for the business. May set direction at a scale much larger than their team. The goals were clearly described, with success criteria, and could talk about the team's orientation around the goals.

- What do you think is necessary in your next role for you to be successful? To feel fulfilled?

### Rubric

- Has a playbook of good practices, but applies it selectively when the context is appropriate. Does not overfit on past experience, but strives to understand the new context first. Has a variety of management styles which they can match to different circumstances.
- Can identify serious mistakes that they've made and how they learned from them. Believe they have further mistakes ahead of them, and don't believe that they've learned it all. Acknowledge situations that were difficult for them, and have grown able to succeed within them.

## Technical Deep Dive (1 h)

10-15 min of presentation, 30-40 min of Q&A.

- What was the hardest technical tradeoff you made? Did you get it right?
- What upstream or downstream dependencies does this system have? What changes in those dependencies could make this system better?
- How long will this system last before it needs to be changed again? What will happen in the future that will cause a change to be necessary?

- Who is your best EM? What makes them great? How are you growing them?
- Tell me about a time you managed a struggling EM. Why were they struggling? What did you do about it? What did you learn from it?
- Tell me about the strongest IC on your team. How are you helping them increase their impact? Are you considering moving them into an EM role? Why or why not?
- Tell me about a time when an otherwise high performer was having a negative effect on the people around them. What did you do about it?
- You quit tomorrow, how's your team? Have you hired or grown your replacement already? No? Why not, what happened? How did you decide what your bench was. How do you see the diversity factor into how you build your bench?

### Cultural champion

- How do you keep a pulse on your team's culture?
- Tell me about a time you detected a problem with culture, and how you fixed it.
- Tell me about the team you built with the strongest culture -- what made it strong? How could you tell it was strong?

### Thoughtful about organizational health

- Tell me about a time when you inherited a struggling team or organization. How did you know it was struggling? What did you do to address it?

- If the TD answers only in terms of execution or strategy, prompt them to discuss how cultural or staffing issues contributed, and what they did to address.

- How is your team organized? What tradeoffs did you consider when you organized it that way? Did you make the right choices? What could still be optimized?
- Have you been involved in a re-org or shutting down of a team/project? Why did the change need to happen? How did you go about it?

### Rubric

Exceptionally deep understanding of their people's strengths and weaknesses, and clear evidence of accelerating them more quickly than normal. Acts as a consistent and thoughtful cultural champion, with several examples of making culture and/or DEI better despite costs. At least one clear example of a "turnaround" where they made a failing team successful. You learned how to tweak your own management approach based on listening to this person's anecdotes.

## Management Roleplay - Sink or Swim Roleplay

A new EM on the team who was previously a strong performer as an eng IC is exhibiting some typical management pitfalls:

- Not working to build trust and respect -- come in and lay out your own vision for the team.
- Not spending time orienting themselves and the team -- e.g., not aligned with the team on performance expectations / career development path.
- Not acknowledging that manager is a different job than IC and is taking on too much of the technical IC work burden, to the exclusion of the development of the people.

Can the manager of managers effectively draw out this information and coach them effectively?

### Evaluating

- Was the candidate able to start a discussion about the situation?
- Does the candidate work with the report to fully understand the scenario, the report's perspective and feelings about it, etc?
- Does the candidate effectively communicate their understanding of the problem?
- Does the candidate actively listen to what the report is saying and adjust accordingly?
- Is the candidate empathetic? Influential?
- How did the report feel about the conversation? Were they understood, supported, and appropriately guided / pushed?
- Does the candidate offer good and helpful ideas and advice?
- Do the report and candidate leave with clear next steps? Are they good ones? Did the candidate bring it to them?

### Rubric

- Is a clear and influential communicator: the manager is influential and inspiring. You could talk with them all day about Stripe, our teams, and what's next for us. You want them to represent you and your team to others in the company.
- Delivers feedback and sets expectations: beyond just clearly delivering the feedback, the manager does so in a way that motivates the impact for the report and the company. The report is very excited to tackle these goals in the coming weeks.
- Listens and adjusts: the manager deftly draws out the report's perspective by listening actively and deepening their questions as needed. The report is certain that they've understood and appreciates the manager's insight.
- Offers clear and well-chosen next steps: the manager provides excellent guidance. They clearly have deep expertise with team dynamics, performance problems, and mentor-mentee relationships. You couldn't have given better advice.

Can TC communicate technical feedback in a constructive and effective manner? Can TC explain the trade offs they considered?

### Evaluation

- The PR's description isn't very detailed.
- The PR includes two different features, plus some refactoring. Should we split?
- The code to calculate the checksum is very complicated, what's the right strategy here for a reviewer?
- The API is changed in place, with a new flag to control the functionality. How do you think we should evolve the API?
- The new unit tests do not cover all test cases.
- The tests in the PR will start failing in a few years due to use of hardcoded times. What's your approach to handling cases like this?
- The comments in PR are not great, what do you think the role of comments in code should be?
- The variable naming and other stylistic issues are not consistent. What's your take?

### Rubric

- Technical feedback: TC identifies high-leverage areas for improvement across the artifact and consistently provides guidance that would likely enable the artifact's author to understand the classes of issues and how to reason through their tradeoffs in the future.
- Written communication: TC's written feedback is consistently clear and concise. Their tone is collegial and they convey to the author an appreciation for their work.
- Tradeoff discussion: TC is consistently able to clearly explain the tradeoffs between options, and consistently mentions positive aspects of options that they did not choose.

Main conflict: a top performer needs to be pulled to another project for 12 weeks, this means their current project needs to stop. Staying on the current project has a clear path to the uplevel, while helping lead the audit project is clearly impactful but less challenging. The top performer is happy with the current project and less excited about the audit project.

From the IC: some potential concerns:

- You don't trust the 12-week time estimate; these projects always go long. Will you be stuck with it after the deadline? Will that reflect negatively on you? You don't feel you have a lot of control over this.
- This kind of audit work doesn't seem to be applauded; you like that you're well known for shipping successful projects at Stripe and want to keep doing more of the same.
- Audit work is just plain not fun, and you feel like you've done your fair share of grunt work for Stripe in the past. You'd like to keep working on something you're passionate about.
- You are afraid your current project will fail without you being there.

Debrief questions:

- In the interview, you'd already decided on which IC to select for the project. How would you select an engineer for this assignment in real life?
- How would you handle the situation differently in the real world?
- Looking back at the conversation, would you do anything differently?
- Ahead of the conversation, what information would you collect?
- What steps / preparation would you take before the conversation?
- What would you do if the engineer was not open to changing their team?

### Rubric

- Communicate and ability to listen: the manager is empathetic and an active listener. Arguments are supported by data, so you clearly understand why you're being asked to change projects, and the path toward success for you personally and the project. You feel supported and understand how you can help the audit, and how this project is beneficial to your career plan. The manager draws out the engineer's perspective by actively listening, asks for your ideas / opinions, and asks questions as needed. The engineer is certain that they've been understood and appreciates the manager's insight.
- Offers clear and well-chosen next steps: the manager provides excellent points for why a project transition is important for Stripe and the engineer's career. They offer suggestions for how to have an immediate impact on the audit. The manager recognizes the engineer should contribute to writing a transition plan for winding down their existing project and spin-up on the audit. They offer advice for how to build relationships and credibility with the new team members and auditors. They work with the engineer to de-risk concerns about making a change. The engineer is left feeling they were able to contribute to next steps and have an action plan was a joint decision.
- How they'd handle the situation in the real world: the manager clearly articulates how they'd identify the most suitable engineer to transition. Offers additional solutions they'd try before asking an engineer to transition, and contingency plans if the transition did not occur. Provides a detailed strategy for how they'd prepare for the 1:1, including scripting their message.
